## v0.0.10
* jfabre - Remove ruby 2.7 warning

## v0.0.8
This release breaks backwards compatibility if you are using the lib components
directly. If you are using the ActiveModel validations in a Rails project then
you should be unaffected.

The major changes when used directly are that you now initialize the objects
with the various strength options instead of the password and then provide the
password to the various methods. The README section on standalone usage has
been updated to reflect this change.
